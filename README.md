This project focuses on the pricing and hedging of various exotic options, specifically Rainbow, Chooser, and Forex options. Rainbow options, which are multi-asset options, are priced using Monte Carlo Simulation with Correlated Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Forex options are priced using the Heston model, known for its ability to model stochastic volatility, and the Garman Kohlhagen Model, an extension of the Black-Scholes model. Chooser options, which allow the holder to decide whether the option will be a call or put at a later date, are priced using the Cox Ross Rubinstein model and the Kou Jump Diffusion model. The project further delves into hedging strategies, demonstrating the practical application of these exotic options. This includes a strategy involving Rainbow options that explores the min-max parity argument using static portfolio replication.
